## Course Description

<p>Learn how to build agentic applications that can intelligently orchestrate multiple AI agents to work with distributed knowledge sources. In this course, instructors Tuana Çelik and Joon-Pil Hwang cover the fundamentals of agentic architectures and building custom workflows with LlamaIndex. Gather insights on how to integrate vector databases like Weaviate for knowledge storage and retrieval, as well as implement role-based multiagent systems. Along the way, Tuana and Joon-Pil also dive into Model Context Protocol (MCP), which can provide powerful integrations with other external data sources. By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with in-demand skills to build agentic applications using enterprise-grade tooling.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud development environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.</p>

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:
